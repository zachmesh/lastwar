# 2026-11-06

All times America/Los_Angeles. Actor Muse, under the owner standing

of 2026-10-28.

- Integrator pass pr-integration-2026-11-06-0000.
  Non-batch pass per the checker (not due, next batch
  03:00): no knowledge or code PR was open. Five records
  PRs await the 03:00 batch, all verified mergeable clean
  by merge-tree against main 267d28ade: PR 345
  (records/2026-11-05, head 1f27dfc0, 12 commits), PR 324
  (records/2026-11-01, head c41db9ea, 2 commits), PR 301
  (records/2026-11-04, head a5294bf0, 14 commits), PR 265
  (records/2026-11-02, head 11b2f383, 5 commits) and PR 256
  (records/2026-11-03, head 6b8df47f, 16 commits). No
  merges, no comments, no escalations. The
  records/2026-11-06 branch was created from main with
  this run record as its first commit, and a records PR
  for 2026-11-06 was opened by this pass. Status: no-op.
  Full detail in pr-integration/0000-run.md.

## 00:15 to about 00:20 - PR integration pass

- Integrator pass pr-integration-2026-11-06-0015.
  Non-batch pass per the checker (not due, next batch
  03:00): no knowledge or code PR was open. Six records
  PRs await the 03:00 batch, all verified mergeable clean
  by merge-tree against main 267d28ade: PR 347
  (records/2026-11-06, head a1ebe896, 1 commit), PR 345
  (records/2026-11-05, head 1f27dfc0, 12 commits), PR 324
  (records/2026-11-01, head c41db9ea, 2 commits), PR 301
  (records/2026-11-04, head a5294bf0, 14 commits), PR 265
  (records/2026-11-02, head 11b2f383, 5 commits) and PR 256
  (records/2026-11-03, head 6b8df47f, 16 commits). No
  merges, no comments, no escalations. Correction to the
  0000 scope wording: the _activities_/ghost-ops/INDEX.md
  entry in `git diff main..branch` on the five older
  branches is a lag behind main (knowledge PR 346), not a
  branch-side change; the merge trees keep main's newer
  blob, so merging reverts nothing. Status: no-op.
  Full detail in pr-integration/0015-run.md.

## 00:04 to about 00:30 - Ticker pass ticker-0004

- Radar unit radar-2026-11-05-2203 FAILED: Mac mini offline with
  no wake-up path, 5 device invokes all node_offline, no game
  screen read, nothing claimed. Same blocker as Issue #284
  (sixty-third recorded consecutive pass, twenty-fourth in the
  worsened zero-response form); commented on #284. Tracker
  untouched. Full detail in radar-tasks/0004-queue-run.md.

## 00:30 to about 00:36 - PR integration pass

- Integrator pass pr-integration-2026-11-06-0030.
  Non-batch pass per the checker (not due, next batch
  03:00): no knowledge or code PR was open. Six records

## 00:32 to about 00:38 - Tool development pass

- Tool-developer pass tool-development-2026-11-06-0032.
  No-op: own PRs checked first (six open PRs, all records,
  no tooling PR open; PR 337 merged with no review
  comments), then all 18 open tooling issues (each already
  implemented on main or diagnosed as needing no tool
  code), then the frozen improvements backlog and the
  standing tool queue. No new tooling item filed since the
  2232 run. No branch, no PR, no issue comment, no Slack
  message. Full detail in tool-development/0032-run.md.
